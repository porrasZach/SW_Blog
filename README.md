# Star Wars Blog



The main purposes behind this project are as follow:
- Create a full-stack application utilizing both frameworks I have been introduced to thus far: Flask & React
- Dig deeper into the Material-UI API via React to design a unique & attractive UI
- More practice with setting up a Flask back-end
- Create my first Star Wars appplication!


I intend on introducing the following functionality to this application:
- User authentication & customizable profile management, including connecting with other users
- Blog posts with additional functionality on their own
- Creation of a new API that stores data on books read by users (or other non-film media), with user CRUD capabilities & automated blog posts associated with entries
- Ability to interact with pre-existing [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) (only currently houses data related to films 1-7)
- Possible web scraping feature to display data from youtini.com (not as robust as finite user queries; possibly a random daily snippet of a character/planet/etc)


### Hope you enjoy!
